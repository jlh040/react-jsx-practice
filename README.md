# React-JSX Exercise

### Functionality:

- This is a very basic exercise that has allows me to practice working with React and JSX.
- In Part 1, I have created three basic components that also utilize *props*.
- In Part 2, I have created a Tweet component that resembles the basic features of a Tweet.
- In Part 3, I created a Person component which displays basic information about a person. I utilized conditional logic and looping in this component.

### Technicalites:

- To see what the HTML looks like on a webpage, you will need to serve the **index.html** files on a server.
- If you have Python installed, first cd into the react-jsx-practice folder, then run `python3 -m http.server` and you can choose to view part-1, part-2, or part-3.
